# cycle_engine
This is a game engine I've been working for a few months now. Even though it uses C++ middleware, its core is mostly written in C, and is data oriented.

So far, its renderer features:
  - deferred rendering
  - shadow mapping
  - normal mapping
  - parallax occlusion mapping
  - bloom (broken)
  - volumetric lights (broken)
  - translucent (and refractive) surfaces (unfinished)
  - PBR materials

An option to allow it to switch to forward rendering is in consideration.  

Physics engine used:
  - Bullet physics
  
Sound playback (deactivated):
  - OpenAL
    
No scripting so far.
